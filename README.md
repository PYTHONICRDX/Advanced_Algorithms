# Advanced_Algorithms(Throughout the entire thing I have mainly used java and python as they are the most commonly used ones(and the only ones I know). Hope it helps.)
1. First program is to print the substring from a string that occurs without any charecter repetition. The method used is hash mapping method.
2. Second program focuses on the uses of OOP where 2 arrays are to be given by the user as input and those two arrays are to be combined and sorted in another array and their median is to be displayed.
